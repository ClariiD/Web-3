			<div class="intro">
				<p>How did it begin?  She was a young girl wanting to connect.  It began with who she was.  How would she reconcile the mixture of three ethnic identities, being all and none of them at the same time?  She sought out others, in the hope that by understanding them, she would understand herself.  Because after all we are all just people, and isn't that enough to live with peace?  Or at least without judgement.  A bit of an idealist, she believed that if people could understand each other just a little bit more, then people could treat each other better. It was not an ideal plan to save the world, just an ideal idea--that was a gesture, a point of paying attention that might alter how we view the world.</p>
				</br>
				<p>Because she was often misunderstood, she felt she had something in common with others who were also misunderstood.  The 'others' in the world who didn't quite fit, who could be everything and nothing at the same time, just like her.  The people around her that existed almost invisibly, who day in and day out worked the same jobs but that made life as in living possible.</p>
				</br>
				<p>She placed so much emphasis on her environment. The environment that shapes who you are and how you are perceived. She studied it, she made many projects on it, which some called very 'socially-conscious'.  She was a 'social designer', as if that was a different kind of designer.  She did not think of herself or her work with the notion of being 'socially-conscious' or that she would change the world.  All she did was continue to search for revealing identity, working through her identity and those who were also working through theirs. It was the identity of those who might have been overlooked or who could not identify themselves.  Their identity was not 'poor', it was just who they were as people.  She continued to make many projects on this.</p>
				</br>
				<p>She travelled the world doing her projects and in the process tried to understand herself better by learning more about her ethnic identities. In seeing the cultures of her roots, while she was enlightened, she still did not belong completely to them.  Nor did they completely accept her as one of them.  After years of travelling the world, she came 'home' with the conclusion that while she could get some answers, they were not all the answers to who she was.  Who she was, was its own manifestation.  Her identity was a synthesis that neither she nor anyone could ever fully define.  She could not break the parts, they were not distinguishable.  She was just who she was.  And she learned to be satisfied with that--at least to some degree.</p>
				</br>
				<p>She wasn't afraid to talk to people, though to some people they thought she was shy.  Because she could be everything and nothing she could either be very talkative with charm, or ghost-out silently in observation. She could walk up to strangers on the street and strike a conversation, and she could listen long enough to hear what they had to say.  She decided to make yet another project about what people had to say, in an attempt to reveal the true identities of where she lived at 'home'.  In the place where she lived, no one was actually from there.  Everyone was from somewhere else, which fascinated her, because while they were from everywhere they had the identity of that somewhere from which they came. Yet they were all here, in her 'home'. This made not the people but the 'home', the place that was like her.  The place that was her 'home' was everything and a mystery. It became not only about the identity of others but how those others then created the identity that was so undefinable.  She sought to understand that identity of those who formed the place of her home.  By understanding the others she could better define, or redefine, what her home is.  She felt her identity on the brink of another shift, about to mold to a new definition of what would become also her, which was who she had been mixed with who she was now.</p>

				<p>Sadar waits in his taxi to pick up his wife in front of Stop and Shop, a clothing store on Broadway in Queens, NY. They often go on these afternoon runs, his wife must find a new dress to wear to their friends' housewarming that night. Like those who welcomed them when they first came to the U.S., they are hospitable to those who are now joining their Bangladeshi community in Queens. It was not so long ago when they arrived, Sadar's wife had won a lottery to come to the U.S. and Sadar left his job as a lawyer to be with her and start their new life together. Upon arrival, Sadar took work as a pizza deliverer, until someone in their community told him he should go into the taxi business.  Driving a taxi has the freedom of flexible hours and a personal means of travel, like the trip he was on now to take his wife shopping.</p>
				</br>
				<p>Sadar's wife comes out of Stop and Shop, at that moment passing a Mexican woman who appears to be holding many bags. Sadar gets out of this taxi to meet his wife who appears to recognize the Mexican woman and asks if she needs help with her bags.  The Mexican woman has just come from the laundromat, she says she is dropping off clothes that were never picked up, some of these clothes will be sold to Stop and Shop, while the others will end up on a rack in front of the 99 cent store.  After helping the woman drop off her bags, Sadar and his wife get in their taxi to head home.  Sadar's wife wishes to make some soup from the squash they grow on their front porch before Sadar starts his evening shift.</p>
				</br>
				<p>They go home and cook together, the squash from the seeds they brought from Bangladesh now turned into a warm soup during the winter months of NY. Over their meal, they take pride in what they have, a simple life but a happy one in which they hope to make happier by soon filling their home with children.</p>
				</br>
				<p>I walk out of my house at 5pm destined to find someone new to know. A designer with a project to define my sense of home and identify once again with those who are different from me. I hail the first cab on Broadway, a few blocks from my home in Queens. Sadar pulls up and I tell him I'm doing a project, where I try to talk to people I don't know and tell their stories. Sadar tells me it's okay for me to talk to him and I find out all the information I have told and am about to tell.</p>
				</br>
				<p>I could not find someone more different from me, who I might meet as a part of regular routine in this city but would never really know. Sadar is Muslim and explains to me that he prays at different mosques around our neighborhood, beginning at the end of this shift in the early morning hours of sunrise at a mosque on Steinway Street.  (continue narrative from Brief, he tells me his wife is in LIC at a housewarming that night, the newspaper and grocery store as part of his world, ends with watching YouTube)</p>
				</br>
				<p>I ask Sadar after our conversation to tell me someone who he does not know but is someone who he would encounter as part of his routine. At first Sadar does not know who that would be, of course how could you remember someone invisible? Then he remembers the Mexican woman from Stop and Shop and tells me his wife does their laundry at a place called Triangle Laundromat a few streets down. Maybe there's someone there I can talk to, one of the women who does their laundry but who is unknown to them.</p>
				</br>
				<p>(Lead into Chapter 2 about Bertha, the unclaimed clothes that end up on the rack at the 99 cent store, she encounters Gong but does not know him, lead into Chapter 3 about Gong)</p>
